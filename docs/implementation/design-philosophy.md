# Design Philosophy

Understanding the design philosophy behind gosaidsno helps you appreciate the trade-offs made and why this approach was chosen over traditional AOP methods.

## The Problem with Traditional AOP Approaches

Traditional AOP libraries often rely on techniques that don't work well in Go:

- **Reflection**: While Go has reflection, it's slow and loses type safety at compile time
- **Code generation**: Requires complex build processes and makes debugging difficult
- **Runtime bytecode manipulation**: Not possible in Go's execution model

## gosaidsno's Alternative Approach

gosaidsno takes a different approach that embraces Go's strengths:

- **No reflection**: Uses Go generics for type safety instead of runtime reflection
- **Compile-time wrapping**: Explicit function wrapping instead of runtime magic
- **Simple architecture**: Easy to understand and debug
- **Performance-focused**: Minimal runtime overhead

This approach trades some convenience for transparency, performance, and maintainability.

## Key Design Principles

### Transparency Over Magic

Rather than hiding the AOP mechanism behind annotations or code generation, gosaidsno makes the process explicit. You register functions, add advice, and wrap them - everything is visible in your code.

### Type Safety Through Generics

Instead of using `interface{}` for all function types, gosaidsno leverages Go generics to maintain type safety while supporting various function signatures.

### Simplicity Over Feature Completeness

The library focuses on the core AOP concepts rather than trying to implement every possible feature, keeping the codebase manageable and understandable.

### Performance Over Convenience

The implementation prioritizes runtime performance over developer convenience, making it suitable for production systems.

## Trade-offs Made

### Explicit vs Implicit

**Trade-off**: Developer convenience vs code transparency
- **Explicit**: Developers must manually register and wrap functions
- **Benefit**: Clear understanding of what's happening, easy to debug

### Compile-time vs Runtime

**Trade-off**: Flexibility vs performance
- **Compile-time**: Wrapping happens at compile time using generics
- **Benefit**: Better performance, type safety

### Simplicity vs Features

**Trade-off**: Feature richness vs maintainability
- **Simple**: Limited to 5 advice types and basic functionality
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand, maintain, and reason about

## Why These Choices Matter

These design decisions make gosaidsno suitable for production systems where:

- **Reliability** is more important than convenience
- **Performance** matters for high-throughput applications
- **Debugging** needs to be straightforward
- **Maintainability** is crucial for long-term success

Understanding these principles will help you use gosaidsno in ways that align with its design goals.
